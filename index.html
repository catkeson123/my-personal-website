          Athletics have always been a strong passion of mine. I've played
          sports for my entire life including football, wrestling, and soccer.
          In high school, I recieved All-American honors in heavyweight
          wrestling in the National Preps tournament as well as All-District and
          All-State honors for football both my junior and senior year. After
          highschool, I was fortunate enough to play football at Dartmouth
          College. At Dartmouth, I found success both individually and as a
          member of the team, having won two Ivy-League championships during my
          time there. Moreover, I was incredibly honored to have received
          various individual accolades which can be found on my resume above.

        During my Udemy class in Python, I created a program to play Blackjack
        using OOP. I then built Blackjack in React in order to aid my learning
        in Javascript. All of the standard rules of blackjack apply (dealer must
        hit until above 17, aces can be both 1 or 11, both dealer and player
        bust above 21, etc.). The game gives the player 100 chips to start out
        and allows them to bet these chips at the start of each hand. The player
        has the option to either continue with an existing game (if they still
        have chips remaining) or start a new game at any point.

        As my final project in one of my programming classes at Dartmouth, I
        created an interactive map of Dartmouth that includes vertices at each
        of the main walking areas on campus. The map allows you to click on any
        vertex on the map and then hover over any of the other vertices to
        determine the shortest walking path between them. The search algorithm
        is a breadth-first search algorithm that utilizes backchaining.

        This is an interactive calendar with a year of your choosing that I
        created in Python using OOP. This project allows you to schedule events
        (with options to schedule them with a time or as daily or weekly
        recurring events), search for events in the calendar with specifications
        such as time or recurring, and finally browse the calendar with all of
        the events you have scheduled.

        During my time at Dartmouth, I built and interactive solar system using
        Python and OOP. It includes the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
        with realistic gravitational pull and orbiting for each body in the
        system. I would have liked to inlcude the rest of the solar system
        (which would have been easy to implement), but given the extreme
        distances between the rest of the planets, it would be difficult to
        simulate them all in the same window.
